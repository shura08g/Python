'''
You are in charge of the cake for your niece's birthday
and have decided the cake will have one candle for each
year of her total age. When she blows out the candles,
sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones. Your
task is to find out how many candles she can successfully blow out.

For example, if your niece is turning 4 years old, and the cake will
have 4 candles of height 4, 4, 1, 3, she will be able to blow out 2
candles successfully, since the tallest candles are of height 4 and
there are 2 such candles.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, n, denoting the number of
candles on the cake.
The second line contains n space-separated integers, where each
integer i describes the height of candle i.

Output Format
Return the number of candles that can be blown out on a new line.
